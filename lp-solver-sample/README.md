# Example LPModel Instances

This package contains some example `LPModel` instances, which are also used
internally in running some validation tests for the different solvers.

* [
  `PrimitiveSolverSample`](src/main/kotlin/io/github/mohitc/lpsolver/sample/PrimitiveSolverSample.kt)
  is a very simple model useful for demonstrating the mechanism to build and
  solver models.
